# RESTful Node JS API
---

My goal with this project is to learn in depth how the REST architecture really works. Right now I understand the concept and have used in a variety of projects (including Java projects) but my intentions were always to become an expert in the subject. In order to have a place to start, I'm following the [Academind's RESTful API youtube's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oXYLzuucwE&index=1&list=PL55RiY5tL51q4D-B63KBnygU6opNPFk_q), but, as always, I'm including personal code and not only stickying to the the videos. Let's get started.

### Rest constraints
---

Just as a reminder the 6 REST constraints are:

+ Client-Server architecture
+ Stateless
+ Cacheability
+ Layred System
+ Uniform Interface
+ Code on demand
