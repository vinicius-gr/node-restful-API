## RESTful Node JS API
---

My goal with this project is to learn in depth how the REST architecture really works. Right now I understand the concept and have used in a variety of projects (including Java projects) but my intentions were always to become an expert in the subject.  Let's get started!

#### Rest constraints
---

Just as a reminder the 6 REST constraints are:

+ Client-Server architecture
+ Stateless
+ Cacheability
+ Layered System
+ Uniform Interface
+ Code on demand
